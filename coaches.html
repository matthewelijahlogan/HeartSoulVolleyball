          <h1>Meet Our Coach</h1>
          <p>My passion, love, and drive for volleyball started when I was age 4 watching my mother play.
              The moment I was allowed on the court to huddle up with her and her teammates, I knew I wanted to be a volleyball player.

              My career officially began at age 13, advancing through club, high school, and college. I graduated
              from Connellsville High School in 2008, where I was a 4-year varsity starter, team leader, 3x All-Section,
              All Conference, and All WPIAL 3rd Team as well as leading our team to a Section 2 undefeated championship season.

        When playing for Penn Highlands VBC, we became their first team to have ever won the OVR Championship in 2006.
        Beating out a field of 192 of the areas best teams,  we took home the title and became their only team to 
        have ever competed at the National level. <br></p>

      <p>
        I progressed to the collegiate level at Seton Hill University, later transferring to Bethany College to finish my career.
        During my time at Bethany, I was able to assist my team in winning ECAC Championships in back to back years (2010 & 2011).
