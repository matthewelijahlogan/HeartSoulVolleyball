          <h1>Meet Our Coach</h1>
          <p>My passion and drive for volleyball started when I was age 4 watching my mother play. 
              The moment I was allowed on the court to huddle up with my her and her teammates I knew I wanted to be a volleyball player. At age 16 I was finally given the opportunity to play with my mom in a women's league. This is one of the best memories I have because i was able to play with the woman who introduced me to as well as shared the love for the game. 

              My career officially began at age 13 playing jr high ball and advancing through club, high school and college.</p>
