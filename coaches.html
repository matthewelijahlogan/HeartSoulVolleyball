          <p>My passion, love, and drive for volleyball started when I was age 4 watching my mother play.
              The moment I was allowed on the court to huddle up with her and her teammates, I knew I wanted to be a volleyball player.
          </p><br>

          <p>
              My career officially began at age 13, advancing through club, high school, and college. I graduated
              from Connellsville High School in 2008, where I was a 4-year varsity starter, team leader, 3x All-Section,
              All Conference, and All WPIAL 3rd Team as well as leading our team to a Section 2 undefeated championship season.
          </p><br>

          <p>
            When playing for Penn Highlands VBC, we became their first team to have ever won the OVR Championship in 2006.
            Beating out a field of 192 of the areas best teams, we took home the title and became their only team to
            have ever competed at the National level.
          </p><br>

          <p>
            I progressed to the collegiate level at Seton Hill University, later transferring to Bethany College to finish my career.
            During my time at Bethany, I was able to assist my team in winning ECAC Championships in back to back years (2010 & 2011).
          </p><br>

          <p>
            My head coaching career began 17 years ago for Penn Highlands Volleyball Club, later coaching at Westmoreland
            Elite and currently at No Borders VBC. During that time, I have been providing private sessions as well as clinics and camps.
          </p><br>

          <p>
            My heart and soul lives for the game and to this day, I still enjoy lacing up my shoes, getting on the court, and balling out.
