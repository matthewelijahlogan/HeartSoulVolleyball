          <p>"My sister and I first met Coach Jess when we attended a clinic held by
            NBVBC a little over a year ago. We scheduled a private lesson with her so 
            that we could work on hitting, but quickly realized we had a lot to learn
            about the game in general. 
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>She started off teaching us the basic skills
            of volleyball but then taught us how to train and improve on the positions 
            that we may play in high school or club.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Coach Jess understands every position and clearly explains how to be 
            good at all of them! Her attitude and love of the game makes sessions with 
            her not only successful, but very fun!
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Coach Jess has a love for volleyball that shows when she coaches, but especially 
            when she plays! We love being on the court with her and have become better players 
            and teammates because of her!"
